# HEW WOD iOS App
iPhone App to see HEW Workout of the Day. This is the first iOS app I've ever written in swift and it's also been a long time since I've written an iOS app (years). I'm sure there are all kinds of ways this code could be better.

## Build notes

```
git clone https://github.com/newtonick/hewwod-ios.git
```

Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and build the frameworks. Run Carthage in the project directory.
